Here is what I did:
Smoothed mutation LUAD data using NetNorM smoothing. I used the raw dataset that came with NetNorM.
Smoothed mutation LUAD data using NBS smoothing. I used the raw dataset that came with NBS.
Smoothed mutation LUAD data using our SVD smoothing. I used the raw dataset that came with NetNorM.
Reduced the dimensionality of all smoothed matrices using t-sne to 3-dimensions
Plot the t-sne reduced data. Here the plots:
