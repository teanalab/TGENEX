*NBS*

This is obtained by:
1. network propagation and quantile normalization
2. NMF factorization (net nmf) k=4
4. assign cluster indexes to the index with maximum score

pvalue =  0.00406846

*STANDARD NMF*

This is obtained with out any network smoothing, just NNLS based NMF (non-negative-constrained least squares)
k=4
clustering index assigned to the maximum score

pvalue = 0.2653275 

*NBS with concensus clustering*

This is obtained by:
1. network propagation and quantile normalization
2. NMF factorization (net nmf) k=4
3. CC with 100 reperitions, 80% of the samples, nmf clustering, k = [2,3,4]
4. assign to clusters using average linkage herarchical clustering of the patients' similarity matrix obtained with CC

pvalue = 0.007446442  

*Standard CC*

This is obtained with out any network smoothing, just concensus clustering with the following settings:
k = [2,3,4]
nSamples = 100
proportion of patients included in CC = 0.8
type = NMF
hard assignment using the max frequency on count of co-clustering pairs

p-value = 0.2551205 

```{r}

```
After runing the above I got these results:
