Network-based stratification (NBS)
=================================
Version 0.2.00

NBS is a clustering approach designed to uncover cluster from somatic 
mutation data in cancer. It is described in detail in the following 
Publication:

Hofree, M., Shen, J. P., Carter, H., Gross, A., & Ideker, T. (2013). 
Network-based stratification of tumor mutations. Nat Methods. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.2651


This package makes use of several external packages we provide as a curtsey 
in the ./external directory. 

This code was last tested using:
Matlab version: 8.0.0.783 (R2012b)

R:  R version 3.0.0 (2013-04-03)
With the following required packages:
survival
R.matlab
impute
pamr
mclust

System requirements:
===================

Running this package will require a machine with 8 GB of RAM. Consensus 
Clustering is a compute intensive procedure. Much of the analysis we mention in
the above manuscript was performed in parallel on a PBS Torque compute cluster. 
We will release an updated version which will include our framework for 
running the NBS method on a compute cluster in the near future. Please check for 
updates or email us directly.


Installation:
============
1. Unpack project and data files. 
2. Start matlab
2. Mex compile mtimesx for your local environment by running:
cd ./external/mtimesx-useThis/
mtimesx_build.m
3. Add library and data directories to your matlab path by changing the 
appropriate variables in the demo files:
library_path
basedata_path







Usage examples:
==============

demo_NBS_simulated.m - Demonstrates simple usage of the NBS method on simulated 
  data.

demo_NBS_TCGA.m - Demonstrates simple usage of the NBS method on publically 
  available uterine data.

NBS_subtypes_to_expression.R - Demonstrates how to use standard pamr (nearest  
shrunken centroid) method in order to translate NBS ovarian subtypes to 
expression subtypes.
